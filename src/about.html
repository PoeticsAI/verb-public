        For most of my life I’ve worked with authors, publishers and literary agents. My second job after college I worked for a agency in New York - it was august, dysfunctional and a wonderful warren of treasure and people. Behind a bookshelf I found a Steinbeck short story, in his own hand. Most weeks I chatted to Harper Lee. But what I remember the most is a yellowed envelope addressed in dark red ink that was handed down from literary assistant to literary assistant. It came with a story - the author sold his blood to afford postage. And that dark red ink was a bit of the blood he didn’t flog.

        <p>It’s a reminder of the lengths we will go to just to write, how strong the human desire to make and share really is. But the kicker is how hard it is to do that - inside the the blood-inked envelope was another, unused self-addressed one. Even after selling his blood this author couldn’t get an answer. He wrote a story but no one ever read it. </p>
      
        <p>At Verb we are here for writers. For the blooded one above and all authors who struggle with the hardest task we have invented for ourselves. Books are the foundation of most of our art – from video games to TV shows to podcasts to films our most important cultural products are based on long form narrative – and perhaps the most difficult. </p>
      
        <p>A book itself is "simply" a coherent, 100k word story that calls for its author to simultaneously be a skilled stylist, resolute planner, organised researcher, incisive editor, and deep student of humanity. Not to mention the resources and time needed to be able to do this and still eat. But still 81% of us want to write a novel eventually. </p>
       <p>
        Our app is built to assist those 81% in their writing, to shoulder some of the load. Photographers, designers, film professionals, podcasters all have software collaborators that contribute meaningful to their craft. Writers have … Word, a transcriber stuck in a different century. This is where Verb steps into the picture.
